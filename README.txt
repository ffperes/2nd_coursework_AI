In this coursework, I will be using procedural content generation AI technique 
to create a dungeon/cave level using cellular automata and tiles.

The first part of the algorithm randomly generates a basic shape of the level. After
that refines it to a proper level representation. After that, creates meshes and 
other visual content.
